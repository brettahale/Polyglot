This library consists of four classes and one function to assist with node
server development. The classes :class:`polyglot.nodeserver_api.NodeServer` and
:class:`polyglot.nodeserver_api.SimpleNodeServer` and basic structures for
creating a node server. The class :class:`polyglot.nodeserver_api.Node` is
used as an abstract class to crate custom nodes for node servers.  The class
:class:`polyglot.nodeserver_api.PolyglotConnector` is a bottom level
implementation of the API used to communicate between Polyglot and your
node server. Finally, included in this library is a method decorator,
:meth:`polyglot.nodeserver_api.auto_request_report`, that wraps functions and
methods to automatically handle report requests from the ISY.
